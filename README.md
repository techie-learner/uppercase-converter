# uppercase-converter
This is the simplest uppercase converter made by me. It's my second projects in GitHub. Used only using print, length, variables(used the .upper()), input and while True function. I convert it to .exe using auto-py-to-exe.

It's very ease to use, jus click it and the interface would open and paste your desired text and press enter and tada! It tells how many characters it has.

To download it, click on the .exe file and click view raw.

There is chance that you may see smartscreen defender blocking you from download , this is because I newly make it and new to smartscreen defender, to download it, click on three buttons (...) and click "Keep" and click there "Keep anyway" and it will download.

After it, smartscreen defender again may stop you, but yes, my .exe file is completely SAFE. So click more info and click "Run anyway" and it will run safely.

If you are still nervous , I will give the images of Image1 and Image2 and click them and download and you can clearly see its safe.
